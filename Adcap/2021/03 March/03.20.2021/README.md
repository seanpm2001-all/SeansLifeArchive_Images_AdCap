# March 20th 2021 AdVenture Capitalist session

This game has proven to be quite the addiction lately. I got lucky today, and quit early. I was only able to collect from Earth, the game crashed when an ad crashed on Mars, and the game would not reload due to a recent Google Play password change that hasn't been fixed.

The session was cut short, and I have much more time now today, although I made less progress in the game, which is fine.

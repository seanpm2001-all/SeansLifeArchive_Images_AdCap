# Excessive session March 13th 2021

I had a very excessive AdCap session today, specifically in the event. I was no longer enjoying it, yet I couldn't stop. I reached rank 1, but it will probably drop down to 2-3 or 4 (hopefully not lower) this is the best I have ever done in an event, however it jeopardized my work for the rest of the day, especially with my broken keyboard issue. I am still trying to find a way to regulate these 2 games without stopping playing either one on the same day, or switching to a different day.

I made a lot of small progress today. It became a major addiction and I used over half of my time warps, but got over 25000 points in the event.

# November 14th 2020 session notes

These are the notes for my November 14th 2020 AdVenture Capitalist session

1. The game was heavily redesigned when it got updated during the recent transfer from a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge to a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. I really don't like the re-design compared to the original version. I wish I could revert. It doesn't even seem that I can make the game display horizontally anymore. The design just isn't as good as the original.

2. The files for this session are labeled as 1440p, they should be labeled as 1080p. This is an error I am trying to stamp out, my new phone has a resolution of 2000x1080/1080x2000 (a downgrade from 2560x1440/1440x2560) and I am having difficulty applying the correct name (1080p) this issue is very similar to the issue of writing the date 2019 for the first few weeks by accident repeatedly in the first month of 2020.

Those are all the session notes for today.

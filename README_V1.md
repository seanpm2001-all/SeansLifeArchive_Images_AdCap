# SeansLifeArchive_Images_AdCap
The module for my life story project that contains my AdVenture Capitalist images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my weekly AdVenture Communist session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.adventurecapitalist.google&hl=en_US&gl=US) there is a version available for iOS. It is listed below

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing AdVenture Capitalist in 2018. I played for a while, but then had a break from it until 2020. I played for a while again, then had a long hiatus from it, before getting back into it. This game was the game after the game that I was playing when I devised my weekly gaming schedule.
